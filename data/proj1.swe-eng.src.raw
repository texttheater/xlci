Speak of the devil.
How will it end?
Tom frowned.
Happy anniversary!
Tom lives with Mary in Memphis.
I hate that idea.
Tom came back to Boston.
That down pillow looks expensive.
She's so fucking charming!
You get the next one.
I see.

I don't know either.
I can make a call.
That's a lie!

Can you answer it?
What do you owe Tom?
Brush your teeth.

Is it blue?
What fruit is red?

I have bills to pay.
Girls came in one after another.
Are you envious?

I'll do as I please.

What killed Tom?
This is a sentence, that has the syllable count, of a good haiku.
This is a sentence, that has the syllable count, of a haiku.
I'd be willing to pay.
Why don't you quit?

Are they speaking French?
We watched him until he was out of sight.
All hands, abandon ship!

What did you bring?
What have you got in your bag?
Keep in touch!
Let Tom stay.
I love this part.
This is too hard.
Please don't interrupt me.
She doesn't like soccer.
Tom helped us a lot.

It still hurts.

One crown and fifty ore.
I want to live in Italy.
The festival will be held next week.
Tom will give you another chance.
I can get you in.
Do you enjoy it?
He attains happiness by means of yoga.
I almost did it.
Stand up!
Tom asked me what happened.
I disagree, it's not racist to use the word "race."
Tom accepted the offer.
Tom is certainly afraid.
Tom is certainly scared.
Tom has his hands full.
We've got to warn Tom.
More and more students are learning Chinese.

Everybody hide!
He is good at singing.
Give me the microphone.
Sami never cooked.
Is your wife still in America?
I really like this book.
The test result isn't what I had expected.
He walked slowly so the child could follow.
Are you afraid of heights?
The room seems awfully dark and spooky.
Enough is enough!

It's not for you.
What time did you go to sleep yesterday?
How did you learn how to play the violin?
What did she reply?
Bananas are delicious.
Hand me the pliers.
It's not a dog.
The long trip aggravated her injury.
I think Tom left.
I am a student.
I'd like to know why Tom and Mary aren't helping us.
Tom is positive, isn't he?
That's what I'm so proud of.
Please take a seat!
It'll be a long day.
You've grown.
What do we want here?
I don't want to spoil the surprise.
How large was it?
Tom said you couldn't come.
I didn't have to go.
Did you record it?
I wonder how Tatoeba can attract speakers of minority languages.
Fadil just went home.
Do you smell smoke?
I want to come home.
What's in the basket?
What a neat idea!
I prefer comedy to tragedy.

I've never felt so good in my life.
Tell Tom to wait.
Bless you.
I am from Norway.
Tom ate a quick lunch.
She got very angry with the children.
What do they think?
Tom would probably choose this one.
Liisa didn't have a clue what to do.
I'm right.
I am right.
I'm hoping to win.
Here's a restaurant I often eat at.
She put on her sister's jeans and looked in the mirror.
I felt at the time like I was in love with Sami.
I'm no good at dancing.
Tom could hardly understand what Mary said.

What genres of music are you into?
There is a bird here.
That's why we got divorced.

Did you notice any errors?
My French is getting rusty.
I'm going to be fluent in Spanish in two months, I swear!

These kittens are so cute and cuddly.
It's always worth a try.
Can I sit there?
Do you know of someone who's never used toothpaste?
Thanks for your email!
Do you have any animals?
That would be rude.
The door opened slowly.
This homeless man plays piano beautifully.
I was at home most of the day.
I knew you'd be busy.
I should've stayed.
She's starting to annoy me.
I know where she is.
I really wish there was something I could do.
Leave me alone.
I think you're nice.
Draw a line on your paper.
Do you like running?
Tell me you're kidding.
Tom is discouraged.
He was born in England, and therefore speaks English.
What are you insinuating?
Crime doesn't pay in the long run.
Don't expect everyone to like you.

My dear friend!
Tom took the pillowcase off the pillow.
I saw that, too.

He usually comes in time.
We don't have another choice.
I'll pay with my card.
My brother helps me with my homework sometimes.
Not all birds can fly.
Here is the car.
The coffee's on me.
A good brandy completes a fine meal.
If you come to Rio, don't forget to call me to be your guide!
It's locked.
Smoking is very bad for your health.
I make you nervous, don't I?
The baby smiled at me.
That could come in handy.
Tom drove back to the farm.
This is bad.
How do I help Tom?
I'll never be able to love you again.
This method is slow but sure.
He is an utter stranger to me.
He was hurt.
We have a choice now.
I said back off!
Many thanks.
A glass of red wine, please.
It sounds like you actually mean that.
Don't be so nosy!
What can Tom say?
I have just finished eating.
Tom is a firefighter.
Our team defeated our opponent 5-4.
Are you from Boston?
Tom has no friends to play with.
I'm a late riser.
Can we bring Tom?
Tom sat by the pool drinking red wine and eating expensive cheese.
Tom's alert.
We can't trust what she says.
Of course.

How old were you when you stopped believing in Santa Claus?
I spoke in class.
It's hard to tell.
Sami came over drunk.
It's on your desk.
How was your day today?
He picked out the best book.
Appearances deceive.
One second, I will just get my pen and paper.
We wish you luck.
I've got company.
Tom's confessed.
My lips are sealed.
He won the game thanks to his strong will.
I think you're nice.
No one would've cared.
You don't look too busy.
Nobody is rich in my country.
I read your report.
Tom made many mistakes.
How much is that?
Could you give me that, please?
It's not a secret.
It isn't a secret.
Fadil followed his ex to her home.
You should go.
I thought you'd like it.
We know who you are.
He gets up at seven.
Who's overreacting?
Don't I get a hug?
They've been very nice to me.
They have been very nice to me.
He's in the hospital.
Neither is beautiful.
It was the window that Jack broke yesterday.
I advised him to come back at once.
We don't sell that book.
We don't have that book for sale.
How many do you want?
Let me ask a question.
Each student has their own computer.
Tom came out from behind the curtain.
It took me more than two hours to translate a few pages of English.
The international conference was to be held in February this year.
I wasn't able to go to his birthday party.

It smells of salt and algae.
I have to see Tom.
I must meet Tom.
I burned the paper.
You've misspelled my name.
Do you think you'll be able to help me?
Be creative.
That's exactly what Tom wants.
I can't break free.
Someone's missing.
Finishing this job by Tuesday will be easy.
I was with someone.
Don't waste Tom's time.
It's got to be now.
I left home at seven.
John lit a match.
These boots belong to her.
That is his car.
You did not say so.
She is an asset to the company.
Tom got lost.
We couldn't go out because of the typhoon.
Why did you buy a turtle?
I don't feel like going out tonight.
Move away from me.
Do you need this book?
Did you buy a new car?
I thought Tom would stay overnight in Boston.
I just got bitten.
Get ready to leave.
You're my hero.
I want this puppy.
I got a C in English.
Whose are they?
I'm terrified.
We're not buying.
Is the hotel far from here?
Tom is an excellent driver.
And what are we doing now?
They're done.
Tom is active.
Sami was trying to live two different lives.
It was very hot.
You're all they have.
Why are you shaking?
All of us are busy.
This bird lives neither in Japan nor in China.
Did she like it?
Are you going out?
He took me in his arms and told me that he loved me.
He never gave in to temptation.
Do you want some?
I'm not wearing that.
I went to the airport to meet him.
Did you buy them?
How hot will it get?
We're having a party Friday evening.
I've got the blues.
It was understandable.
Mary thought that Tom was asleep.
I can hardly see without my glasses.
I left you a message.
I like climbing.
I live nearby.
Tom couldn't make up his mind.
He returned home after being away for ten months.
I think that Tom is truly decent.
Tom handed Mary the box.
He deserved it.
I've already told Tom what he ought to do.
More and more students are joining the protests.
I didn't want to see them again.
I would like something to drink.
I'd like to hear that.
The house is big.
Sami kept trying.
When I came home, my father had already been there.
Tom has talent.
I'm satisfied.
Tom took the bus to school.
What did we get?
You sound disappointed.
It's not important what my name is.
I'd like to borrow this.
We're right here.
I'll be here.
We need to rest soon.
I have a cold.
She got on a bus and took a seat in the front.
He suddenly stopped.
I'm going to join a demonstration.
Will he ever come back?
How do I do it?
How do I do that?
I don't shampoo my hair in the morning.
Tom flexed his arms.
I said sit down.
Stay put.
This dog breed has very special markings.
This is the most beautiful sunset I've ever seen.
Does the room have a bath?
I think we're next.
Tom would've gone with us if we'd invited him.
That's none of my business.
It's not my business.
That's of no concern to me.
He reached his goal.
That's fine.
I've done that at least a hundred times, I think.
How much of this is Tom's fault?
Sami continued reading the letter.
I hate myself.
Where is my newspaper?
Tom is never wrong.
She can't stop me.
She cannot stop me.
He is a mathematical genius.
I'm using the computer.
Come to the meeting.
What does a Sovietologist study?
One year has twelve months.
Do you need a grater?
They play bridge every free moment.
No one is there.
When he smiled, the children saw his long, gray teeth.
Tom couldn't understand Mary's nervousness before the act before he himself got stage fright.
Lo and behold.
My body is not as flexible as it used to be.
I'm a little crazy.
Don't touch my stuff.
Tom isn't in there.
She's lost her car key.
You can't quit now.
Poor crops may cause famine.
I don't know who sings this song.
Has everybody found their mistakes?
Tom and Mary are the same age.
Get on your horse.
Tom has never had a job.
He loves me.
I hope that's not true.
It could be worse.
I just try not to think about it.
Tom's parents are both murderers.
Maybe he's not young.
Get dressed quickly.
The milk will keep for two days.
Do you like snow?
Do you want an apple?
What was Tom doing here?
What did Tom do here?
Tom's mean.
Are you really Canadian?
What else needs fixing?
When I was born, my mom was just fifteen.
I can be honest.
He held his breath.
Put the radio on, please.
I have blue eyes.
I substituted flour for oatmeal.
Where do you buy bus tickets?
Your analysis is correct.
Where's your car?
Sami never told Layla that he was married.
I like to be here.
Women want to have sex too.
He's living on unemployment benefits.
I'll do it now.
We live close to the station.
Tom's father, who is in prison, never writes to him.
We are Arabs.
It's an anachronism.
By mistake, he turned left instead of right.
I prefer to walk.
"I'm hungry," said the small white rabbit, so they stopped and ate the flower from a large hyacinth.
When I was in school, left-handed kids were forced to write with their right hands.
I washed the dishes after I'd eaten dinner.
I differ from you on that point.
Tom wanted Mary to cooperate.
You're babbling.
She's trying to commit suicide.
We'll have to work on that.
I'm very fat.
Somebody answered.
Tom needs help.
What would you have done differently?
Hey, come back here.
You said Tom was different.
This is outrageous!
I ordered the children to stay quiet, but they kept on making noise.
This car looks happy.
Australian soprano Joan Sutherland was dubbed "La Stupenda" after a performance in Venice in 1960 and the label stuck for the rest of her career.
I can't understand anything he said.
Her voice echoed through the silent house.
Do you need money?
Tom was nosy.
What you were taught is wrong.
Thank you for coming.
It's stuck.
Have you seen Tom yet?
Tom got a speeding ticket.
He has a dog.
I made a serious mistake on the test.
It's the first time I pray in a mosque.
Your name has been removed from the list.
He suddenly stopped.
I'm going to miss you guys.
Give Tom some space.
We can still do that.
Where is your room?
I think we should wait.
Who painted that?
It's safe to eat the fish.
How awesome is that?
He has become taller and taller.
Which is the heavier of the two?
I won't be voting for Tom.
This is a safe place.
I can't put up with his insolence.
What is the new leader like?
Mary ran.
What are you fighting for?
The crazier, the better.
She knows better than to argue with him.
How many people live here?
She became a police officer.
I was born with twelve fingers.
Tom looks agitated.
He ran, so as to arrive on time.
Are you kidding?
You aren't needed.
Did you have fun over the weekend?
You can't control me.
I just cleaned this.
I fainted.
Tom had cancer.
I hope it works.
Do you agree?
Everyone hesitated.
I have an announcement.
This is Tom's school.
This is not a mistake.
How did you hurt your hand?
That is how he always treats me.
The letter has just arrived.
I'm cold.
Take care not to catch a cold.
When he was younger he worked at a factory.
Give me that envelope.
Fadil used Layla's phone.
I didn't need your help.
He hurt himself on a rusty nail.
What did you think I was going to do?
You can't go with us.
I can handle that.
It's my job.
Tom accidentally deleted all the files on one of his external hard disks.
He asked me if I liked mathematics.
We have eaten eggs.
I just finished reading Wuthering Heights.
Every family has one.
I need to learn French.
There's a pea in my right nostril.
He is always kind to animals.
Where was he born and raised?
How many days do you want to stay in Boston?
Her nail polish had begun to come off.
I abhor spiders.
Nobody cares about your life.
I think it's over.
He's already left.
You must bring your passport with you to the bank.
I wish I had learned French when I was a kid.
Can you come closer?
How much is a beer?
How much does a beer cost?
How much is one beer?
Someone stole my passport.
When do they play soccer?
I scarcely believed my eyes.
Take a nap if you're tired.
Why can't Tom talk?
Tom knows you're here.
I'll get your coat.
I want to eat something that isn't sweet.
That's awful.
Art has no limits.
Art has no borders.
I saw one yesterday.
He took her back to his place.
I live in Peru.
He had to go there.
I am loved by my parents.
My niece is a nurse.
I'll do it for you.
We had a good time.
We had a nice time.
Tom won't hurt you.
Listen up, students!
Women deserve equal rights.
Just give it a try.
I didn't want to see them.
How did you convince her?
I just need a little air.
I can smell flowers.
What an awful mess!
Did you enjoy the tour?
The teachers teach.
Do you accept this card?
They laid the carpet on the floor.
I thought I was alone.
The cost of living has gone down.
Give me the tickets.
Do you belong here?
If you don't eat, you die.
A red dress looks good on her.
I'll never understand.
Are you out there?
She studies audiology.
What conclusions can we draw?
The houses are burning.
Go back to bed now.
Just go back to bed.
I knew you'd come to your senses.
You know him better than I do.
Can I give you this?
He robbed me of my purse.
That blonde girl with curly hair is from Sweden.
Tom knows you're here.
These candles aren't white.
He got hurt seriously in the traffic accident.
Everything's changed.
How are you?
What's it like?
By the way, how old are you?
Tom looks confused.
Did you get married?
I'm Finnish.
You're smarter than I am.
We are going to have a baby.
I knew you'd come to your senses.
What caused the power failure?
Naoko swims.
I leave for Paris tomorrow.
Don't laugh!
I don't know what this word means.
English, as you know, is very much a living language.
He wants to play soccer this afternoon.
I can't remember exactly.
He was brave.
Tom turned on the table lamp.
Yesterday was Thursday.
I recognize you.
You're looking tired.
Look, look!
They'll get over it.
The green lampshade casts a warm glow in the room.
His book became an object of criticism.
He filled the glass with wine.
It was almost 2:30 when Tom finally got home.
Are they still here?
Sometimes cows are killed by coyotes.
There are innumerable stars in the galaxy.
I climbed a tree.
Tom wondered why Mary was so upset.
How does this soup taste?
I have a boyfriend.
I want that job.
Don't touch it!
In my country, people can't stand others who are more intelligent than they are.
She is like my own child.
Can you understand this language?
You gave it to us.
This is very fresh.
Study hard.
It's my decision.
Tom told Mary about John.
She was swimming.
Where's the newspaper?
I was so nervous.
I really love you.
We only kissed.
It is probable that she will come.
She'll probably come.
Will you look after our pets while we're away?
You're almost thirty.
I made a serious mistake on the test.
Try and do it.
What a useful gadget!
If you don't have money, you have to do without.
Again.
I shall stay here for the time being.
They export a lot of fruit, such as oranges, grapefruits and lemons.
Christmas is only two weeks off.
He never woke up.
I trust the teacher.
Tom is a communist.
Did Tom see you?
Answer the question.
Tom took off his clothes and stepped into the shower.
I really needed that.
Throw it to Tom.
I'll go get my car.
Tom is a choirboy.
He is the champion.
This isn't a competition.
I wimped out.
I love you too.
Call him tonight.
They're not my rules.
Criminals should be punished.
His health is getting poorer and poorer.
Comfort Tom.
Forget him.
Security was increased in the city.
I filled the cup.
It has to be removed.
Time flies.
It's probably haunted.
Tom seemed lost.
Some people like coffee and others prefer tea.
We are influenced by our environment.
She sent me her address so that I could find her house.
I eat a book.
I had a dream about him.
Give me three hours.
I just want to rest.
Did I miss something?
He fights windmills.
It is the calm before the storm.
Thanks for your hard work.
How long do you plan on staying here?
How long will you stay here?
Who'll tell Tom?
Chai tea often contains cardamom.
She didn't even open the present he gave her.
I'm going on a run.
I wasn't ready for this.
Rub the stain with vinegar.
Tom got embarrassed.
We shall not forget.
Is this the guy you wanna marry?
Did you feel that?
I stayed home last night to be able to receive your call.
Tom found the missing money.
On one hand he is kind, but on the other hand he is lazy.
Whose side are you on?
I feel like I've already seen this movie.
You're so paranoid.
I'm on my way now.
Sami e-mailed his boss.
Tom looked at Mary.
She is here.
Do you mean that?
I'm not wearing that.
When he comes, we'll begin.
I don't want to talk about it right now.
I can't fake it.
We'll have to wait.
The prisoner was found guilty.
Tom's early.
He is not always in the office in the morning.
Where did you grow up?
This is a picture of the ship I was on.
Don't expect everyone to like you.
She wants to become a citizen.
