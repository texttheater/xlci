He still remembers the day his mother found out he was smoking .
I 'm from Sapporo .
Did it not occur to you to close the windows ?
Sami still cares about Layla .
I was only there for three days .
Can you drive ?
I 've only got one left .
I 'll be very careful .

Have you finished your homework already ?
Tom is n't himself today .
Are your hands clean ?
Show me the photos , please .
Since you 're here , we might as well begin .
Tom does n't have either a cat or a dog .
Tom did it in his own way .
His plan is dangerous !
You can come with us .
Nobody 's going to hire you .
I 've heard nothing .
The same to you .
Will he come tomorrow ?
Do you speak French ?
They decided to get married .
How are you , Mrs. Jones ?
How do you do , Mrs. Jones ?
Nobody cares about that .
Let 's get some sleep .
Nothing happened .
What does she see in him ?
How many eggs are there in the kitchen ?
The rain has let up , so we can begin .
I turned right .
Tom is a Homo Sapiens .
Listen and learn .
Arabic is n't a difficult language .
I 've been a teacher for two years .
You work too hard .
This is the case .
Layla burned Fadil alive for his money .
Where are they going to ?
Do you love each other very much ?
Will you help me ?

It 's only a theory .
The washbasin is made of granite .
Why is Fadil here ?
She spoke rapidly .
The essence of liberty is mathematics .
The book is here .
He talked about her illness .
Do n't worry about me .

Fadil lied to me .
What shall I do with her letter ?
We came back by way of Hong Kong .
I wake up early .
Goodnight , Mother .
Are you a student ?
I was very tired last night .
No one knows .
If Tom finds out I told you this , he 'll kill me .
We 'll see what happens .
Prices are high these days .
Out of my way , boy .
This story is based on a true story .
Here are our books .

I have a lot of things I have to do before tomorrow .
Will it rain today ?
Do you need an ambulance ?
How long did you stay in Canada ?
Is that car yours ?
Mother is cooking in the kitchen .
When Sami goes home , he goes straight to his computer .
See to it that the door is locked before you leave .
Who do you want to talk to ?
I always find myself comforting people with the words I want to hear .
Are you a student ?
English is spoken in America .
Is he a teacher ?
That 's my book .
Your house is fantastic .
We only have tea .
I came late because I missed the bus .
I study for 3 hours every day .
She went there yesterday .
No single speech can eradicate years of mistrust , nor can I answer in the time that I have all the complex questions that brought us to this point .
He brought food to his guest and provided him shelter .
Your answer is right .
I do n't meet him so often .
Bring him to me .
Sami heard the bell ring .

I did n't want you to leave me .
I 'm a little tired .
Close the door .
He shut the door .
Is there something in the refrigerator that we can drink ?

Mastering a foreign language is n't easy .
Who died ?
What time do you usually go to bed ?
Eat your vegetables .
Did n't I ask you not to do that ?
The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak .
You should n't say that kind of thing when children are around .
We 'll have to pay back that loan one way or another .
I do n't remember what happened anymore .
I 'm looking forward to doing this again .
They look American .
Sami has read every one of those books .
