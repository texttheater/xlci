Tom said Mary was planning to go by herself.
I hope that you will get well soon.
Tom said that he really enjoyed the concert.
Doing that isn't difficult.
She started to cry.
Tom said he'd quit doing that.
You still think I'm bluffing?
I wish I could've seen them.
To teach young children is not easy.
Tom may get fined if he does that.
She made a mental note of that information, which she thought might be useful in the future.
She says she likes flowers.
Tom told me he thought that what Mary had done was unethical.
Tom said that's not what he wanted to do.
We continued chatting.
The dog's sleeping in the car.
He wants to be a tennis player when he grows up.
Tom might be the traitor.
Nobody else at the party spoke French.
I told Tom that I wasn't busy.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to do that for them.
Tom should've called Mary.
Nobody other than Tom can do that.
She leapt from her chair.
Tom hasn't finished writing the report yet.
I like to learn ancient languages.
I like learning ancient languages.
I like learning old languages.
Tom said he got out of the way.
Tom hasn't let his children do that very many times.
What made Tom mad?
You could have run.
I am as tired as you.
I'm as tired as you.
Tom and Mary told John they didn't plan to go with him.
I wonder whether Tom really wants to do that.
Tom and I are both ambitious.
We're talking about our friends.
I wonder whether or not Tom is happy.
I wonder if Tom is happy.
I wonder whether Tom is happy or not.
Tom might be surprised.
Tom said that he wasn't sure Mary should do that.
I probably swim better than Tom does.
I suspect Tom and Mary have already left for Boston.
It could have been me.
You should've killed me when you had the chance.
I don't yet know what to do.
I am a translator.
It is no use arguing with him.
Tom and Mary let me know that they were planning on doing that.
Tom did that as soon as he was able to.
Tom said he wanted to play poker with us.
Tom told Mary that she shouldn't go there alone.
He's just a petty hooligan, but if he had just a little more initiative, he could be a major criminal leader.
Tom said that he did that for Mary.
I don't speak Hebrew.
There was no one in the room.
Tom said he found the noise irritating.
Tom said that he hoped that Mary would do that right away.
Tom said he hoped Mary would do that right away.

Tom's parents let him do anything he wants.
I was surprised when Tom and Mary said they were planning on going to Boston.
Tom said that Mary should've done that by herself.
Do you believe in ESP?
You could've knocked.
I wasn't aware Tom hadn't done that yet.
I wasn't aware that Tom hadn't done that yet.
I'm thinking of closing my savings account.
Tom is passed out.
Both Tom and Mary laughed.
Tom said that he knew Mary might not have to do that.
That's a pretty colour.
Tom said Mary didn't seem to be angry.
How did the accident come about?
It's unlikely to rain tomorrow.
Tom said he's not happy.
Tom wondered what Mary was planning to make for dinner.
Both Tom and Mary know what you're doing.
Tom and Mary say they didn't plan on doing that.
She's smart and beautiful.
I haven't seen you for a long time.
Tom wondered what songs Mary was planning on singing.
We both have to do that again.
Tom said he didn't need to do that now.
I want to go home.
Tom said that he thought Mary might have to walk home by herself.
I'm sure someone will do that for Tom.
I should have won.
She has a cute accent.
Tom said that he thought that Mary wanted to do that for John.
Tom said that he thought I should buy a new car.
Tom hasn't yet been sentenced.
I hope somebody will do that for Tom.
I am a widow.
I suspect that Tom is scared.
Tom says that he can't help.
Please tell Tom that I called.
Tom does things I don't like doing.
It doesn't matter whether we do that now or later.
Go ahead!
He achieved his purpose.
He achieved his goal.
Tom may even end up back in Boston.
We're planning on doing that together.
I'd like to improve my Spanish.
Tom told me that I shouldn't eat that.
It must have been very painful.
Tom said that he knew Mary might not want to do that.
You should go in person.
You'd better go in person.
Tom said he spoke to Mary yesterday.
It's mine.
Tom said that he wasn't disappointed.
Tom said I should've stayed and helped Mary.
Tom is interesting.
I didn't know that Tom lived with his aunt and uncle.
Tom is not my friend anymore.
I can't eat all of this.
I doubt if Tom would've done that.
Tom said that he knew that Mary would win the race.
I hope that Tom and Mary get here soon.
Tom said he didn't expect anyone to help him.
Tom put his jacket on.
That's a depressing thought.
I am sending a copy of my letter to you.
Don't forget to water the plants!
Tom must have thought Mary wasn't going to do that.
It'll probably rain.
I'll teach you a lesson that you won't forget.
Tom said he'd do that and he did.
I never would've thought that I'd meet you here.
I'll wait until four o'clock.
I should've let Tom take it away.
I should have gone hunting.
Tom and Mary live with their mom.
I'm horrified.
Tom and Mary said they plan to stay until Monday.
A dictatorship means, by definition, one center of power.
You're a genius.
Tom said he goes out with Mary at least once a week.
Tom said he didn't really know how to ski very well.
Tom said he'll call you later.
That would've been too much.
I never should have said those things.
I should never have said those things.
If everything goes according to plan, I should be back home again tomorrow night.
If all goes according to plan, I should be back home again tomorrow night.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be at home.
How many times do are you planning to do that?
I would have stopped doing that if Tom had asked me to.
I'd have stopped doing that if Tom had asked me to.
How I miss you!
She handed out a key to him.
That's an understatement!
I baked some brownies for Tom.
The landscape of yellow, a mass of sunflowers flourishing beyond measure.
Someone has been here before us.
He seems tired.
Tom said that he knew what Mary wanted to do.
We are doomed.
How is it going?
Tom should've never retired.
I cannot possibly come.
Tom said he didn't know if he had time to do that.
Tom said he agreed to do that.
Tom said he wished he hadn't tried doing that by himself.
Tom said that he wished that he hadn't tried doing that by himself.
That ball could've hit me.
How do you plan to stop Tom from doing that?
It's bad manners to point at people.
Tom said he doesn't plan to go hunting again.
Tom has already been told that he has to do that.
What are Tom and Mary planning to do after they retire?
Do you remember when Tom said he was planning on doing that?
Tom isn't about to give up now.
Somebody is following us.
Tom and Mary are now living by themselves.
Nobody seems to know why Tom wasn't at Mary's party.
I'm not as good at playing chess as Tom is.
I didn't know whether Tom and Mary were busy or not.
He was severe with his children.
Stop shooting.
Tell Tom that it wasn't my fault.
The baby cannot walk yet.
Tom, Mary, John and a few other people are planning on going fishing this afternoon.
Tom said that he didn't mean to hit me.
They are talking with each other.
I got my son to fix the door.
Don't you think we should've talked to Tom about this?
I've just come back from a long trip.
Nobody does that other than you.
Tom chose the colours.
It'll probably be difficult for you to do that.
Is there anything else you'd like?
We have never done it before.
I suspect that Tom and Mary are serious.
There was nothing Tom could've done to prevent the accident.
I should've paid in advance.
Something's not right with Tom.
There is not enough coffee.
Tom said he didn't believe that Mary and I actually did that by ourselves.
I wonder whether Tom is relieved.
Tom said that he was hoping that you'd win.
I told Tom I disagreed.
It's very important.
I don't know if I can do that or not.
Tom said that he was hoping to see you.
Tom's a very tall boy.
I don't even know whether Tom and Mary are still alive.
Tom said that he didn't know who Mary was planning to give that to.
You should've warned me that this might happen.
Tom is unlikely to do that again.
You've bought more stamps than needed.
Tom likes fruit more than vegetables.
Tom said he thought Mary might be frightened.
Tom said that he thought that Mary might be frightened.
Tom said that he thought Mary would be awake when he got home.
Tom said that he wouldn't be willing to do that for me.

That's an order!
Tom said that he knew that he might need to do that on Monday.
Tom said that he knew that he might not be permitted to do that at school.
Tom said he knew he might not be permitted to do that at school.
Tom might've gone home already.
Stop interrupting me.
I'll never drink again.
It appears we will have to work harder.
I have no reason to learn that language.
I am not going to betray you.
I think that I could do that.
I'm not sure that I want to see it.
She cannot stop it.
Tom is frightened.
I'm new here.
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me.
Tom said he doesn't know how to do that.
Tom could've been the one responsible for what happened, but we don't think so.
I have never seen anything like it.
I'm not sure I understand.
Tom said that he heard Mary singing this morning behind the school building.
Tom is planning to go tomorrow.
Maybe next time you'll listen to me when I tell you to be careful.
The cat burglar must have entered the mansion from the roof.
It's going to be hard for me to do that.
Tom told me that he'd agreed to do that.
I wonder if we really could talk Tom into donating some money.
Hit the brakes.
Tom has done that twice.
Tom might not have done that.
Tom said he doesn't care if I do that.
I wonder whether Tom is adopted or not.
I wonder whether or not Tom is adopted.
I wonder if Tom is adopted.
My name's Ricardo.

Do you think that Tom and Mary were bored?
They are good people.
Tom said he thought I should buy a new car.
Tom said that he thought that I should buy a new car.

Why does everyone hate Tom?

Is this the kilo, the package or the unit price?
Tom said he plans on going on Monday.
Tom said that he plans to go on Monday.
You should've tried some of Tom's homemade pie.
I can do that better than you can.
I'm not the only one who could've done that.

For me, it is important.
Who do you plan on going with?

A penny for your thoughts.
Everyone's standing.

I'm such an idiot.

These are the shoes I bought last week.
Tom said that he was pretty sure that you would do that.
How much water does it take to fill up your swimming pool?

Tom said he doesn't eat pork anymore.
He dedicated his life to medicine.
Tom and Mary are both very upset.
They went on travelling for two days through a great forest, without food or drink, and without coming across a single house, and every night they had to climb up into the trees for fear of the wild beasts that were in the wood.

Tom said he was the only one who wanted to do that.
Tom is going to be late today, too.

Tom said he was glad that Mary did that.
Tom said that he was glad Mary did that.
I am going to introduce you to my family.

As a child, he went to Paris three times.
I am going to have a nap.

We're confronted with a difficult situation.
Tom is already planning on doing that.
He eats nothing more than fruit.
He doesn't eat anything other than fruit.
He eats nothing other than fruit.
He eats nothing but fruit.
Please come.
Tom isn't the only one who can do that.
Tom must have been horrified.
I should've done this weeks ago.
I'm in charge of this.
Tom and Mary put their jackets on.
That's water under the bridge.
Tom must have known this would happen.
I suspect that Tom is doing that now.
Tom said he was afraid of heights.
I cannot find time to read the book.
Without you I am nothing.
Without you, I'm nothing.

What made you come here?
What brings you here?
It's possible.
Please don't leave me.
Tom told me he thought Mary was healthy.
Tom needs to call someone to repair the agitator on the washing machine.
What're you working on?
Follow him!
I wonder whether or not Tom has already told Mary she doesn't need to do that.

Buckle your seatbelt.
Tom's smarter than we are.
Tom was lucky that there was somebody there to help him.
Tom should have been willing to do that.
If you want to leave now, then you'll have to find somebody else to drive you home.

I'm pleased to meet you.

Education is the key to success.
Tom told me he'd been careless.
Tom said that he didn't want to do anything.
He owned up to his fault.
Tom said that he thought that Mary would be bored if we did that.
Everyone knows Tom did that.
I was not lonely.
I wonder whether Tom wants to buy that for Mary.
I'll never be able to look him in the face again.
I thought you said you wanted to know who Tom and Mary were planning to that with.
What is the delay?
My wife's pregnant.
Tom told me he couldn't blame me for breaking my promise.
Tom said he hopes that you're able to do that.
Tom said that he hopes you're able to do that.
Tom and Mary are planning to go to Boston next week, aren't they?
I'm sure Tom needs to do that.
Don't push your luck.
I suspect that Tom and Mary are bluffing.
You don't remember anything?
Be quiet while we're eating.
Tom must've run all the way home.
Tom hasn't been blamed for the problem yet.
Somebody must have stolen your watch.
Someone must've stolen your watch.

Both Tom and Mary should have left earlier.
Tom and Mary both should've left earlier.
Tom said he saw nothing.

Tom should've finished it by now.
I think I would have heard the door open if Tom had come in.
Tom and Mary both speak French.
Tom sneaked up behind Mary.
Tom said that he found it difficult to do that.
I figure that there is no point in trying to persuade him.
He cannot stop them.
I love you too.
Both Tom and Mary turned around to watch.
Go ahead and do that if you think it'll make you happy.
He hasn't written to them in a long time.
I wonder whether Tom is dangerous.
Tom planned on staying, but he got a phone call and left.
He's nervous and gets scared easily.
The telephone is ringing.
The phone is ringing!
He cannot swim a mile.
I know Tom is right.
You must go.
Tom and Mary managed to put the fire out by themselves.
Tom says he doesn't plan to do that by himself.
This is real difficult.

What is the main purpose of this plan?
Why are Tom and Mary planning on doing that?
Tom said that he I thought I should do that myself.
I think Tom would have done that.
Tom should've known better than to believe Mary.
Let's party.
Nobody I know needs to do that.

I thought that you were going out with Tom.
I knew we should've stayed in Boston.
Tom and Mary said they didn't plan on doing that anymore.
Tom said that he hasn't seen Mary since they got divorced.
Do you really not like them?
Tom said that Mary told him not to do that.
I think it must've happened just the way Tom said it did.
It's a long story.
Let the children play.
I should've been notified about this earlier.
What's the name of your dog?
Tom said he should have done that.
Tom said that he should've done that.
I can't tell them apart.
You may do that anytime you want to.
I wonder if Tom is really colorblind.
Tom doesn't have any idea when Mary wants to do that.
Tom and Mary aren't planning on staying together.
Nobody ran.
I cannot excuse her.
Tom hasn't been told he shouldn't do that yet.
No decent human being could possibly think this.
I am playing the guitar now.
Both Tom and Mary are very young.
Anyone who doesn't want to go, doesn't have to.
Tom says he's good at doing that.
I am not a con artist.
I'll let Tom know that you're here.
Is that OK with you?
Tom said he thought that Mary was suspicious.
Tom said that he thought Mary was suspicious.
Mary planned on staying at home by herself.
I probably should have asked Tom that question.

Do you want anything to eat?
Tom and Mary say they think that's not going to happen.
I suspected that Tom and Mary were planning to do that together.
Tom didn't know that Mary wasn't planning on doing that.

No, don't go.
You do that a lot better than Tom.
Tom said that he thought that Mary would be asleep when he got home.
Were both Tom and Mary able to do that?
I think that we're making good progress.
It isn't safe for a girl to go out by herself so late at night.
Nobody has been punished yet.
I should've gone to the dentist last week.
I think you could have done this by yourself.
Maybe you should've thought of that before you did what you did.
That's an old-fashioned expression.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know who John was planning on giving that to.
It's snowing.
The weather is fine today!
I called Tom's house, but nobody answered.

We are waiting for Tom.
Tom is not easily satisfied.
I wasn't aware that I was supposed to do that.

They gave us a warm greeting.
I wish somebody would do that for Tom.
They love their kids.
The pain is gone.
Even though he lives next door, he doesn't even say hello to us.
We can't exist without food.
Tom said that he wasn't having fun.
You will soon get used to Japanese food.
If you'd asked me to do that, I would have.

Tom said that he'd rather not go to Boston with us.
Tom said that he wished he hadn't told Mary to show John how to do that.
Tom would've never done that if Mary hadn't asked him to.
Where's my food?
As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
Mary says she isn't planning to stay inside all day.
I think it's cruel to keep a cat indoors.
I cannot say.
How did you know Tom was unhappy here?
Both Tom and Mary were very hungry.
Tom could've been confused.
Tom didn't know what he was going to do yet.

Tom should have had a little more patience.
I wonder whether there'll be more snow this year than last year.
I am tired of hearing you moan and groan.

Wait a little longer.
I would have stayed in Boston longer if I could've.
I would've stayed in Boston longer if I could have.
I am an adult.
Tom did nothing wrong.
We should've expected that to happen.
I didn't know if Tom and Mary were Canadians or not.
Tom must've been busy.
Tom said that he thought he'd be able to get that done today.
You should have studied harder.
I'm very sorry for what I said.
Tom should have been with us yesterday.
Tom can do it better than I can.
I wonder if Tom is really guilty.
Tom didn't tell Mary he was leaving.
If I'd had enough money, I would've bought that computer.
I wonder whether Tom was surprised.
I still think we should've told Tom to come.
Tom said he didn't need a break.
I don't speak French as well as Tom does.

That was not necessary.
Tom should have given Mary more time to do that.

I'm very grateful for your help.
Tom gave his old camera to Mary.

Tom thinks that doing that is a bad idea.
Sooner or later, Tom will likely agree to help us.
I have only been there once.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
I wonder whether we'll ever see Tom again.
Tom said he didn't plan to go there by himself.

Tom said he saw something suspicious the morning Mary died.
It's happened before.
Why didn't any of my babysitters ever look like you?
They collect our rubbish every Monday.
I am a conservative.
Did anybody eat lunch with Tom?
Tom said that he wasn't in good enough shape to go mountain climbing.
I've decided that I'll do that.
I think Tom is hiding something.
I can't imagine what you must have been going through.
I'm not sure I'll be able to help you with that.
I don't know if Tom and Mary live in Boston or not.
Tom said that he didn't really want to talk about this.
Does anyone in your class speak French?
Tom and Mary cried for help, but no one heard them.
Tom and Mary have told me they're planning to stay where they are.
Nobody will listen to you.

I should have checked.
I rarely stay out late.
I seldom stay out late.

His wife is a Frenchwoman.
Tom told me that he'd drive Mary to the airport.
I missed you a lot.
My name is on the door.
Leave.
Tom knocked out one of Mary's teeth.
Tom's busy.
The law is harsh, but it is the law.
Tom says Mary doesn't like doing that.
Mary is my niece.
Tom said he knew why Mary had to do that.
You could've changed.
Tom's parents allow him to do anything he wants.
Tom's parents allow him to do anything he wants to do.
Tom's parents let him do anything he wants.
You don't mean that, I am sure.
We are looking forward to seeing you.
Tell Tom why you plan on doing that.
I suspect that Tom had nothing to do with this.
Kids, listen!
I wonder whether it's safe to camp here.
Has Tom done that already?
Tom said that he had trouble doing that.
Tom stood up and then everyone else stood up, too.
I should've tried harder to get the report finished on time.
Do you plan on permitting Tom to do that?
Do you plan to let Tom do that?
I wonder whether Tom and Mary are done.
Tom would have done the same thing Mary did.
I was surprised when Mary said she was planning on going to Boston.
I want to know why you thought that I was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought that Mary wasn't happy.
Tom said that he thought Mary wasn't happy.

Everyone here but Tom has done that.
Everyone here except Tom has done that.
I am completely exhausted.
Why isn't anything happening?

I think Tom and Mary have finished.
Did you get your girlfriend a souvenir?
Tom said that he was amused.
I suspect Tom doesn't want to get married.
Tom said he thought he had to speak French.
Tom said that he thought that he had to speak French.
Tom can't do that as well as Mary.
Tom won't be able to do that by himself.
Tom won't be able to do that on his own.
I wonder whether Tom and Mary are going to say anything about what happened.
The sky's the limit.
Who would have dreamed that Tom would ever graduate?
Tom said he wanted me to teach him how to do that.
Do you think Tom would've wanted us to do that?
Nobody can help Tom.
It looks so good.
What've you been doing recently?
Tom sure was mad.
Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be interested in doing that.
Tom told Mary he was busy.
I wish there was more I could have done.
Tom is singing.
I should've trusted my instinct.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still trustworthy.
I should've told you sooner.
Tom told me that he's decided to do that.
I would've loved to meet Tom.
Don't make a fool of yourself.
I would've shown you how to do that.
You never should have left your husband.
Everyone seemed to be afraid but me.
I stayed at home all day yesterday.
I'd rather not go there alone.
Hurry it up.
Obviously, Tom didn't know how to do that.
I don't know whether Tom and Mary speak French or not.
If I'd had enough money, I could've bought it.
We must defeat our enemies.
Tom could've been a teacher.
Who is missing?
Tom says that Mary is very busy.
I suspect that Tom will probably have to do that.
Even today the temperature is below zero.
What does the sign over the door say?
Both Tom and Mary live on Park Street.
Tom won't likely want to do that.
I'm reading a book now.
What is the name of this street?
I'm afraid that I'll make a mistake.
I would've gone to Boston if I could've.
Tom said that he sold his house for $300,000.
Tom says he would've done that if we'd asked him to.
Both Tom and Mary felt like outcasts.
Well done.
Be yourself!
Tom said that he'd win and he did.
We should've done what you advised.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was alone.
I think it is a gift.
Tom told me he likes you a lot.
Tom said he was thrilled to be back.
I am only a man.
Tom and I both want to go.
I graduated the same year as Tom did.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Tom told me he wants to go to Boston.
You have no heart.
I think it wouldn't be hard to do that.
They are my classmates.
Tom said Mozart was his favorite composer.
Tom says learning a foreign language is hard.
I'm sure it must've been very disturbing.
It is not worth the trouble.
You are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts.
Somebody is looking for you.

I'm already acquainted with that situation.
I doubt if anybody has told Tom yet.
I don't think that Tom was surprised.

Tom knows I'm homesick.
On what grounds were you fired?
Why were you fired?
We should have planned more carefully.
Tom doesn't have any idea who'll be at the meeting.
Tom said that he'd be willing help us.
It is hard to understand.
I am from Budapest.
Tom told me he thought Mary had left.
I am going to apply for a scholarship.
I'm very happy.
I'm quite sure that Tom and Mary are planning to be at your party.
I am an Uyghur.
Doing that won't likely be very difficult.
Tom said he thought that doing that wouldn't be dangerous.
Tom said that he thought doing that wouldn't be dangerous.
Tom said that he was going to ask Mary to do that for him.

I wish we'd told Tom to come as well.
Tom told me he thought Mary was upset.
She's sitting on the bench.

You should tell Tom that Mary is planning to stay.
Tom knew that I was broke.

Something tells me I should've said no.
If Tom can't do that, no one can.

I am interested in swimming.
It might not be as hard to do as you think it'll be.

The night is young.
The night's still young.
Let somebody else do that.

What will the neighbours think?
Tom is not crying.
It might not have been as hard as Tom said it was.
It might not have been as difficult as Tom said it was.
It may not have been as hard as Tom said it was.
I don't have anyone to lean on.
I love you so much!
Perhaps it might've been better to do it that way.
It's clearing up.
You look kind of like Tom.
Pray!
That wasn't difficult to do.
Go and see if Mr. Wilson is at home.
I wonder whether Tom and Mary are free this afternoon.
She doesn't need to work.
I believe you've been trying to contact us.
He gives some meat to the dog.
There is something wrong with my car.
Tom probably doesn't yet know how to read or write.
We are all in this together.
I am coming.

Ghosts don't exist.
Tom said nobody was awake.

Please tell me you're joking.
I'm fed up.
Tom could have come with me.
Tom told me it was possible to rent a bicycle.
She says that she likes flowers.

I've climbed Mt. Fuji.
Tom knew Mary told everybody she wasn't going to go to Boston.

There are many budget airlines in Europe.

Keep your nose clean.
It would have been better if you had gone to Boston with Tom.
That wasn't the main reason why Tom should've done that.

I should have advised Tom to stay away from Mary.
Tom told everyone that he was cold.
Tom told everyone he was cold.
Tom could've done that, but he didn't.

Come whenever you want to.
Tom told me that he thought Mary had been rude.

I haven't yet told anybody what we need to do.
She doesn't have any brothers.
I wonder whether or not this is some sort of scam.

Tom said he probably isn't going to do that.
The climate here is very mild, and snow seldom falls even in winter.
I'm not sure it's wise for you to do that.
Tom would have turned thirty next month if he hadn't died in the accident.
His face turned white.
I am not satisfied with your explanation.
I will write to you.

I think that Tom told you the truth.
Do you think it would be OK to do that?
I like maths.
I like mathematics.
Tom has lots of things he needs to do today.
She is a maniac.
No one was listening to us.
I don't care about anyone else!
Don't let that happen again.
There's no alternative.
Don't swear!
I'm as rich as Tom is.
I'll buy the same thing you do.
Mary says she doesn't plan on doing that anymore.
It isn't difficult to do that.
Leave it.
You know they won't allow you to do that, don't you?
She's a blonde girl.
Tom is thrilled.
Tom could have gone camping with you if you'd let him know you were going.
You're planning on doing that tomorrow, aren't you?
I'm not like her.
Tom called me on the evening of the 20th.
It was perfect!
Tom isn't able to do that anymore.

Don't make me wait.
I'm always leaving my umbrella on the train.
I always leave my umbrella on the train.

I'll do that if Tom and Mary both want me to.
I suspect Tom is bluffing.
It is by no means easy to master a foreign language.

What've they done to you?

I should've done that with Tom.
My behavior was very odd.
Please help him.
Tom is OK now.
Tom's all right now.
Tom said that he had never planned to stay that long.
These shoes are so tight that I can't put them on.
You've got to be intrepid!
Keep quiet!
Tom and I'll both be there.
I am ashamed.
Tom is much taller than Mary is.
We should've heard from Tom by now.
We are truly pleased.
You should have gone home already.
Everything's changing.
I should have done that last summer.
I suspect Tom is outraged.
It's going to be harder than you think.
Sorry, I don't understand.
Tom wouldn't speak to anybody.
Tom asked if it would be OK if he did that.
I'm sure that Tom would be disappointed to hear that.

I don't know if Tom and Mary have a brother or not.
Tom said he'd rather do that by himself.
Tom may be out.
Tom gave me the key.
Tom said he knew what Mary wanted to do.
Both Tom and I have Canadian wives.
It's obvious Tom doesn't want to talk about what happened.
I wonder whether Tom and Mary are homesick.
You should've seen the look on Tom's face when Mary walked in.
He's a nobody.
Tom said that he thought that Mary would need at least $300 to buy everything she needed.
At what time is sunrise?

Tom said he thought I might have to do that today.
Tom told me that he was depressed.
How is your family?

That's how most people do that.
I suspect Tom and Mary have been hurt.
Tom said that he didn't have to do that until Monday.

There's no one here who can do that.
No one I know can do that.
Nobody I know can do that.

What're your plans for tomorrow?
It's a pity you don't know how to dance.
See you later!
We are going to have a meeting here tomorrow.
Tom will likely be angry.
I imagine that's how I'd do that.
I don't know if Tom and Mary are good teachers or not.

Tom and Mary know they aren't very good at speaking French.
You're not paying attention.

I think this is funny.
Didn't anyone help you?
The smell was terrible.

Please tell Tom it's important to do that before 2:30.

Do you have a home phone?

We should read one book a month at least.

There is nothing to do.
That's great.
For how long will you be staying with us?

Calm down.
You should have come sooner.

No one's seen her.
Much is riding on the outcome.
Why didn't you need to be there by 2:30 like everybody else?
