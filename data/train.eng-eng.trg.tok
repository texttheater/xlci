There is no way I 'm going to let you do that .
I 'm not used to drinking water from the tap .
Where is my jacket ?
I hope Tom is wrong .
Tom and Mary said doing that was harder than they thought it would be .
I did n't think Tom was making any sense .
Tom thinks that if he 'd tried a little harder , he could have won the race .
There was nothing left in the refrigerator .
Tom said that he knew Mary would n't be able do that .
Tom said that he knew Mary would n't be able do that .
I think that we 're making good progress .
Tom said Mary was planning on going by herself .
I hope you 'll soon get well .

Doing that is n't hard .
She began crying .
Tom said that he 'd quit doing that .
Do you still think I 'm bluffing ?
I wish I could have seen them .
Teaching young children is n't easy .
Tom might get fined if he does that .
She silently filed away that piece of information , thinking it might be useful later .
She says that she likes flowers .
Tom told me that he thought that what Mary had done was unethical .
Tom said that is n't what he wanted to do .
We carried on talking .
The dog is sleeping in the car .
He wants to play tennis when he 's older .
Tom may be the traitor .
No one else at the party spoke French .
I told Tom I was n't busy .
Tom and Mary say they have to find somebody to do that for them .
Tom should have called Mary .
No one other than Tom can do that .
She leaped from her chair .
Tom has n't yet finished writing the report .
I like to learn old languages .
I like to learn old languages .
I like to learn old languages .
Tom said that he got out of the way .
Tom has n't let his kids do that very many times .
What made Tom angry ?
You could 've run .
I 'm as tired as you are .
I 'm as tired as you are .
Tom and Mary told John they did n't plan on going with him .
I wonder if Tom really wants to do that .
Both Tom and I are ambitious .
We are talking about our friends .
I wonder whether Tom is happy .
I wonder whether Tom is happy .
I wonder whether Tom is happy .
Tom may be surprised .
Tom said he was n't sure Mary should do that .
I probably swim better than Tom .
I suspect that Tom and Mary have already left for Boston .
It could 've been me .
You should have killed me when you had the chance .
I do n't know what to do yet .
I 'm a translator .
It 's no use arguing with him .
Tom and Mary let me know that they were planning to do that .
Tom did that as soon as he could .
Tom said that he wanted to play poker with us .
Tom told Mary that she should n't go there by herself .
He 's just a small - time thug , but if he had just a little more moxie , he could be a big -time boss .

She always speaks English .
There was nobody in the room .
Tom said that he found the noise irritating .

Do you believe in extrasensory perception ?
You could have knocked .
I was n't aware that Tom had n't yet done that .
I was n't aware that Tom had n't yet done that .
I am thinking of closing my savings account .
Tom has passed out .
Tom and Mary both laughed .
Tom said he knew Mary might not have to do that .
That 's a pretty color .
Tom said Mary did n't seem to be mad .
How did the accident happen ?
It 's not likely to rain tomorrow .
Tom said he 's unhappy .
Tom wondered what Mary was planning on making for dinner .
Tom and Mary both know what you 're doing .
Tom and Mary say they did n't plan to do that .
She 's beautiful and intelligent .
I have n't seen you in a long time .
Tom wondered what songs Mary was planning to sing .
Both of us have to do that again .
Tom said that he did n't need to do that now .
I wan na go home .
Tom said he thought Mary might have to walk home by herself .
I 'm sure somebody will do that for Tom .
I should 've won .
She 's got a cute accent .
Tom said he thought that Mary wanted to do that for John .
Tom said he thought I should buy a new car .
Tom has n't been sentenced yet .
I hope someone will do that for Tom .

Tom says he ca n't help .
Please tell Tom I called .
Tom does things that I do n't like doing .
Whether we do that now or later does n't matter .
Go ahead .
He reached his goal .
He reached his goal .
Tom might even end up back in Boston .
We 're planning to do that together .
I want to improve my Spanish .
Tom told me I should n't eat that .
It must 've been very painful .
Tom said he knew Mary might not want to do that .
You had better go in person .
You had better go in person .
Tom said that he spoke to Mary yesterday .
It is mine .
Tom said he was n't disappointed .
Tom said I should have stayed and helped Mary .
Tom 's interesting .
I did n't know Tom lived with his aunt and uncle .
Tom is n't my friend anymore .
I ca n't eat all this .
I doubt if Tom would have done that .
Tom said he knew that Mary would win the race .
I hope Tom and Mary get here soon .
Tom said that he did n't expect anyone to help him .
Tom put on his jacket .
That is a depressing thought .
I 'm sending a copy of my letter to you .
Do n't forget to water the plants .
Tom must 've thought Mary was n't going to do that .
It will probably rain .
I 'll teach you a lesson you wo n't forget .
Tom said that he 'd do that and he did .
I never would have thought that I 'd meet you here .
I 'll wait till four o'clock .
I should have let Tom take it away .
I should 've gone hunting .
Tom and Mary live with their mother .
I am horrified .
Tom and Mary said they plan on staying until Monday .
A dictatorship means , by definition , one centre of power .
You are a genius .
Tom said that he goes out with Mary at least once a week .
Tom said that he did n't really know how to ski very well .

That would have been too much .
I never should 've said those things .
I never should 've said those things .
If all goes to plan , I should be back home again tomorrow night .
If all goes to plan , I should be back home again tomorrow night .
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be at home .
How many times do are you planning on doing that ?
I would 've stopped doing that if Tom had asked me to .
I would 've stopped doing that if Tom had asked me to .
How I miss you .
She handed him the key .
That 's an understatement .
I baked Tom some brownies .
The landscape was a measureless yellow mass of flourishing sunflowers .
Someone 's been here before us .
He looks tired .
Tom said he knew what Mary wanted to do .
We 're doomed .
How 's it going ?
Tom should have never retired .
I ca n't possibly come .
Tom said that he did n't know if he had time to do that .
Tom said that he agreed to do that .
Tom said that he wished he had n't tried doing that by himself .
Tom said that he wished he had n't tried doing that by himself .
That ball could have hit me .
How do you plan on stopping Tom from doing that ?
It is bad manners to point at people .
Tom said that he does n't plan to go hunting again .
Tom has already been told he has to do that .
What are Tom and Mary planning on doing after they retire ?
Do you remember when Tom said he was planning to do that ?
Tom is not about to give up now .
Someone is following us .
Tom and Mary are living by themselves now .
No one seems to know why Tom was n't at Mary 's party .
I 'm not as good at playing chess as Tom .
I did n't know if Tom and Mary were busy or not .
He was strict with his children .
Stop shooting !
Tell Tom it was n't my fault .
The baby ca n't walk yet .
Tom , Mary , John and a few other people are planning to go fishing this afternoon .
Tom said he did n't mean to hit me .
They 're talking with each other .
I got my son to repair the door .
Do n't you think we should have talked to Tom about this ?
I have just come back from a long trip .
No one does that other than you .
Tom chose the colors .
It 'll probably be hard for you to do that .
Would you like anything else ?
We 've never done it before .
I suspect Tom and Mary are serious .
There was nothing Tom could have done to prevent the accident .
I should have paid in advance .
Something is not right with Tom .
There 's not enough coffee .
Tom said he did n't believe Mary and I actually did that by ourselves .
I wonder whether Tom is relieved or not .
Tom said he was hoping that you 'd win .
I told Tom that I disagreed .
It 's very important !
I do n't know whether I can do that or not .
Tom said he was hoping to see you .
Tom is a very tall boy .
I do n't even know if Tom and Mary are still alive .
Tom said he did n't know who Mary was planning to give that to .
You should have warned me that this might happen .
Tom is n't likely to do that again .
You 've bought more stamps than necessary .
Tom likes fruit more than he likes vegetables .
Tom said that he thought Mary might be frightened .
Tom said that he thought Mary might be frightened .
Tom said he thought Mary would be awake when he got home .
Tom said he would n't be willing to do that for me .
You 're free to say what you think .

Here 's my telephone number .
This is an order .
Tom said he knew that he might need to do that on Monday .
Tom said that he knew he might not be permitted to do that at school .
Tom said that he knew he might not be permitted to do that at school .
Tom may have gone home already .
Stop interrupting me !
I will never drink again .
It seems we will have to work harder .
There is no reason for me to learn that language .
I 'm not going to betray you .
I think I could do that .
I 'm not sure I want to see it .
She ca n't stop it .
Tom 's frightened .
I am new here .
Sticks and stones may break my bones , but words will never hurt me .
Tom said that he does n't know how to do that .
Tom could have been the one responsible for what happened , but we do n't think so .
I 've never seen anything like it .
I 'm not sure that I understand .
Tom said he heard Mary singing this morning behind the school building .
Tom is planning on going tomorrow .
Maybe the next time you 'll listen to me when I tell you to be careful .
The burglar must have entered the mansion from the roof .
It 's going to be difficult for me to do that .
Tom told me he 'd agreed to do that .
I wonder whether we really could talk Tom into donating some money .
Hit the brakes !
Tom has done that two times .
Tom may not have done that .
Tom said that he does n't care if I do that .
I wonder whether Tom is adopted .
I wonder whether Tom is adopted .

My name is Ricardo .

He dedicated his life to medical work .

A man who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client .
Did n't anybody follow you ?
Tom must have hit his head .
Tom swims better than Mary .
Tom said that he was the only one who wanted to do that .
Tom is also going to be late today .

When he was a child , he went to Paris three times .
I 'm going to have a siesta .
Both Tom and Mary were overweight when they were teenagers .

Tom is not the only one who can do that .
Tom must 've been horrified .
I should have done this weeks ago .
I am in charge of this .
Tom and Mary put on their jackets .
That 's old hat .
Tom must 've known this would happen .
I suspect Tom is doing that now .
Tom said that he was afraid of heights .
I ca n't find time to read the book .
Without you , I am nothing .
Without you , I am nothing .
Tom said he 'd almost given up .
Tom must 've died .
What has brought you here ?
What has brought you here ?
It is possible .
Please do n't leave me !
Tom told me that he thought Mary was healthy .
Tom needs to call someone to repair the agitator in the washing machine .
What are you working on ?
Follow him .
I wonder whether Tom has already told Mary she does n't need to do that .

Fasten your seatbelt .
Tom is smarter than we are .
Tom was lucky that there was someone there to help him .
Tom should 've been willing to do that .
If you want to leave now , then you 'll have to find someone else to drive you home .
I am pleased to see you .
I am pleased to see you .
Tom told Mary that he was glad that that was going to happen .
It is education that is key to the success .
Tom told me that he 'd been careless .
Tom said he did n't want to do anything .
He acknowledged his mistake .
Tom said he thought that Mary would be bored if we did that .
Everybody knows Tom did that .
I was n't lonely .
I wonder if Tom wants to buy that for Mary .
His face ca n't be seen straight again .
I thought you said you wanted to know who Tom and Mary were planning on doing that with .
What 's the delay ?
My wife is pregnant !
Tom told me that he could n't blame me for breaking my promise .
Tom said that he hopes that you 're able to do that .
Tom said that he hopes that you 're able to do that .
Tom and Mary are planning on going to Boston next week , are n't they ?

Do n't you remember anything ?
Be quiet while we are eating .
Tom must have run all the way home .
Tom has n't yet been blamed for the problem .
Somebody must 've stolen your watch .
Somebody must 've stolen your watch .
I wonder if Tom and Mary are busy .
I 'm not sure that you 're ready .

You are kidding me , are n't you ?
Both Tom and Mary should 've left earlier .
Both Tom and Mary should 've left earlier .

Tom came in through the back door .
His explanation was not satisfactory .
Tom should have finished it by now .
I think I would 've heard the door open if Tom had come in .
Both Tom and Mary speak French .
Tom snuck up behind Mary .
Tom said he found it difficult to do that .
I think there is no point in trying to persuade him .
He ca n't stop them .
I love you , too .
Tom and Mary both turned around to watch .
If you think it 'll make you happy , go ahead and do that .
He has not written to them for a long time .
I wonder if Tom is dangerous .
Tom planned to stay longer , but he got a phone call and left .
He 's nervous and easily frightened .
The phone is ringing .
The phone is ringing .
He ca n't swim a mile .
I know that Tom is right .
You must get going .
Tom and Mary managed to put out the fire by themselves .

No one wants you here .
It has started raining .
What 's the main purpose of this plan ?
Why are Tom and Mary planning to do that ?
Tom said he I thought I should do that myself .
I think Tom would 've done that .
Tom should have known better than to believe Mary .
Let 's party !
No one I know needs to do that .
Tom remained seated .
I thought you were going out with Tom .
I knew we should have stayed in Boston .
Tom and Mary said they did n't plan to do that anymore .
